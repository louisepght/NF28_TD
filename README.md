# NF28_TD

NF28 : interactive system

This repository is made to manage the code produced in the NF28 course during 2022 spring semester (from beginning of march to mid-april). The code is made in class.

The objective of the course is to introduce us to Java and build a first and very simple app using MVC model. The code might not follow all the best practices as it is an introduction class.
